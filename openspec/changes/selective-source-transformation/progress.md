# Implementation Progress

## Authority And Target

- User authorized implementation, signed commits/push, sequential PR merges
  after CI/CD and independent review, and 1.6.0rc1 publication. No stable release.
- GitHub CLI checked: authenticated; repository ADMIN access. Homebrew git
  required because system git invokes unaccepted Xcode license.
- Branch: codex/1-6-transformation-rc, based on main d89dc4d.
- Heartbeat automation active every five minutes; no duplicate/overlapping work.
- Use Caveman and Ponytail. Read this file first; do not rerun unchanged gates.

## Current Slice: Client Finding 19

- Added deterministic directory access-time regression tests. Baseline: 2 fail,
  9 pass. Shared publish_directory/replace_path compared complete stat objects.
- Fix compares directory identity; regular files retain identity, ctime_ns and
  size checks. Absent/present transitions remain checked. No overwrite expansion.
- Focused tests: 90 passed across path policy, I/O workflows/commands, workspace.
- Ruff passed; full production mypy passed (109 files).
- Path-swap tests cover source/destination directory and symlink replacements.
- Changes not yet committed/reviewed/pushed. Independent review remains pending.
- Documentation inventory initially rejected the new active proposal; updated
  its explicit inventory and checks for the unfinished transformation plan.
- Documentation tests: 49 passed; Ruff and strict OpenSpec validation passed.

## Remaining Decisions And Work

- Transformation runtime not implemented. Safety-policy exception must be scoped
  explicitly and independently reviewed with tests; existing generation stays
  source-free. Do not silently allow sensitive preservation.
- Client script replay and all other findings: see client-acceptance.md; not
  yet completed. Missing private inputs are unverified, never passed.
- Profile/inline YAML/CSV mapping, wizard, agent parity, Decimal and source
  adapters remain pending. Latest voice decisions recorded in plan/tasks/design.
- Shared mapping required within a linked dataset; independent runs may differ.
  Explicit shared mapping across separate runs is opt-in, not a universal mandate.
- External script/API substitution is unapproved future TODO. Future integration
  feedback has not arrived; do not invent it.
- Finish full documentation reconciliation and installed candidate/client tests,
  independent exact-SHA review, release gates and public acceptance before closing.

## Next Action

Complete path-publication slice tests/review and open a focused signed PR; merge
only after green gates. Keep the broader proposal explicitly unfinished.
